* Programmer: Kollin Labowski
* Date Completed: September 27, 2020
* Course: CS 350
* Description: This program includes a function isPrime(int a) that determines whether a number is prime or not (more description below), and a main method
* which tests this function on the numbers 1-10000, printing out all of the numbers for which the function evaluates as true. This particular version of the
* program uses a loop with size sqrt(n) instead of n/2, which was stated in the problem assignment.

/*
* This function determines whether a number is prime or not by using loops. It first checks and evaluates the unique cases of 1 and 2 individually. It also
* is able to determine immediately that a number is not prime by checking if it is even. Otherwise, the function will loop and determine whether the input
* value is divisible by each odd integer that is <= the square root of the input number. This function uses a loop that terminates at sqrt(n) instead of n/2.
